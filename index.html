            exponential utilities </a>, ArXiv (2024).</summary>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
            In an arbitrage-free simple market, we demonstrate that for a class of state-dependent exponential utilities, there exists a unique prediction of the random risk aversion
            that ensures the consistency of optimal strategies across any time horizon. Our solution aligns with the theory of forward performances, with the added distinction of 
            identifying, among the infinite possible solutions, the one for which the profile remains optimal at all times for the market-adjusted system of preferences adopted.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
            We consider a family of conditional nonlinear expectations defined on the space of bounded random variables and indexed by the class of all the sub-sigma-algebras of a 
            given underlying sigma-algebra. We show that if this family satisfies a natural consistency property, then it collapses to a conditional certainty equivalent defined in
            terms of a state-dependent utility function. This result is obtained by embedding our problem in a decision theoretical framework and providing a new characterization 
            of the Sure-Thing Principle. In particular we prove that this principle characterizes those preference relations which admit consistent backward conditional projections. 
            We build our analysis on state-dependent preferences for a general state space as in Wakker and Zank (1999) and show that their numerical representation admits a 
            continuous version of the state-dependent utility. In this way, we also answer positively to a conjecture posed in the aforementioned paper.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
            In this study, we propose a new formula for spread option pricing with the dependence of two assets described by a copula function. The advantage of the proposed method 
            is that it requires only the numerical evaluation of a one-dimensional integral. Any univariate stock price process, admitting an affine characteristic function, can be 
            used in our formula to get an efficient numerical procedure for computing spread option prices. In the numerical analysis we present a comparison with Monte Carlo simulation
            methods to assess the performance of our approach, assuming that the univariate stock price follows three widely applied models: Variance Gamma, Heston's Stochastic 
            Volatility and Affine Heston Nandi GARCH(1,1) model.

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
